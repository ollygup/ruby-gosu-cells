# ruby-gosu-cells

A first year degree, semester 1 assignment

Ideas taken from agar.io



-A very simple game that allows you ( a cell ) to eat other cells in order to grow

-There is no end for this game, score can be saved in the score.txt, or not ( quit game extensively before returning to main menu )

-There is no way to clear all the scores in score.txt, unless it's done manually

-able to change color of the character, settings will not be saved for next game ( after restarting )
